            <li>Soak one cup sweet almonds in water for eight hours. The soaking helps in better digestion and absorption of almonds in the body as nuts contain phytic acid which inhibits the absorption of many vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li>Remove the peels. Put almonds in grinder, add some lukewarm water and grind well.</li>
            <li>Strain this through cheesecloth to get extract. Again put the grinded almonds from cheesecloth, in grinder and grind again adding some water.</li>
            <li>Keep repeating till smooth Almond milk is obtained.</li>
            <li>You can store this in fridge for 3-4 days. You can add green cardamom to this milk for improving aroma and taste.
Almond milk prepared from one cup or 100 gm, is good for four servings.  Each serving provides approximately 105 calories, 4g of protein, 3.6g of carbohydrate, 1.9g of fibre, 23 mg of calcium, 5.1mg of sodium and 9.2 g of total fat.</li>

 It contains cellulose, that increase the excretion of stools by increasing the water content and bulk and it also elevates the viscosity. Anjir fruit pulp paste increase the intestinal peristalsis, and give relief in  chronic constipation. Three pieces of anjeer have 5 grams of fiber. Fiber enables healthy and regular bowel management. These are quite useful not just in treating constipation, but also in indigestion, stomach-ache, and various other intestinal problems.<br><br>

Anjeer fruits and leaves have been extensively used in the management of plasma glucose level. They contain healthy compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and antioxidants that play an important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These flavonoids have antihyperglycemic properties that alter glucose and oxidation metabolisms. Flavonoids present in them modulate glucose transport and significantly decrease elevated plasma glucose level.<br>
Ferulic acid is a predominant phenol compound that suppresses high plasma glucose level and alleviates oxidative stress. Antioxidants present in anjir neutralize the harmful free radicals and combats oxidative stress.<br>
Anjeer Leaves are more beneficial than anjeer fruits. Anjeer leaves help in supporting functional control of diabetes. The leaves regulate the amount of sugar captivated into the body after meals. Blood sugar alteration rate may become less frequent.

Research has shown that dried anjeer help in relaxing the gut. This property is attributed to the presence of ALKALOIDS, FLAVONOIDS, COURMARINS, SAPONINS, and TERPENES. It has also shown to have an anti-spasmodic effect, that is, it helps to relieve spasm of muscles. Anjeer also inhibits contractions and thus, helps the muscles to relax. Because of its anti-spasmolytic effect, it has also been recommended for the treatment of different hyperactive gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Anjeer has a very rich nutrient profile, that is, it is an important source of many vitamins, minerals, phenolic compounds, antioxidants, and flavonoids. The presence of so many health-promoting compounds in anjir helps to modulate the immune response and alleviates diseases.<br><br>
The Total White Blood Cell Count also increased in a group treated with anjir fruit extract. This increase may be related to the presence of phenolic compounds such as CAROTENOIDS, FURANOCOUMARINS, PSORALEN, and ANGELICIN. These phenolic compounds strengthen the immune system and boost the production of white blood cells.

Anjeer tree leaf extract has hypolipidemic activities and it helps in lowering plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels but increased the plasma levels of HDL – high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (good cholesterol). Such an increase in HDL cholesterol level protects the heart and keeps cardiovascular diseases at bay. The leaf extract increases the production of APOLIPOPROTEIN A-1 and modifies remodeling of HDL particles within the blood vessels.
In addition to this, APOLIPOPROTEIN A-1 also contributed to anti-inflammatory and antithrombogenic (prevents the formation of a clot and thus, protects against heart diseases) properties. Therefore, it also cuts the risk of coronary heart diseases.

Some of the phenolic compounds present in anjeer exhibits anti-caries activity. This activity is due to the ability of its extract to inhibit oral bacteria. Furthermore, the presence of flavonoids in it exhibits anti-bacterial properties and thus, protects against the harmful action of bacteria. Therefore, the presence of flavonoids and phytochemicals in this fruit play an important role in reducing the oral bacterial infection and thus, provides protection to gums, teeth and overall tissue of the oral cavity. Therefore, anjir can be employed as a natural anti-bacterial agent in oral care products.
